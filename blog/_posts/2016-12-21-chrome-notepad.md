title: Using Chrome as a Notepad
tags: [chrome]

Suppose you are browsing the web and suddenly want to quickly note down something,
you have to go and open Notepad, OneNote or other similar app.

Imagine if you could do that right in the browser!

It is really possible.

Enter `data:text/html, <html contenteditable>` into the omnibox.
It brings up a blank page onto which you can start typing!

And this trick is not limited to Chrome and may work in other modern browsers too!

## Something More
You can use the omnibox as a calculator.
Just type in the equation and Chrome's omnibox gives you the answer, no need to press Enter.

You can also do the same with basic unit conversions.
All you need to do is add an equal signs after a query.
For e.g. `80 c = f` for temperatures, or `90 feet = inches` for length.
