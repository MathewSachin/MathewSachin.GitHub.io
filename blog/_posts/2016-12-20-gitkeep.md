title: .gitkeep (Track Empty Directory)

Git does not track empty directories.
In order to track a directory, a file must exist within it.
A trick that many people use is to create a hidden file usually called *.gitkeep*.
The name of the file doesn't matter.
As long as there is a file in the directory *.gitkeep*, *README.md* etc, git will track it.

If you have a empty directory that you'd like to track, create a hidden file. eg. *.gitkeep* and commit it to the repository.
