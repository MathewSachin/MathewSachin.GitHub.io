If your phone is unresponsive and you can't reach **Settings** icon, you may be able to reset your phone using the hardware buttons.

On Lumia phones (and some others), do the following to reset your phone:

1. Press and hold the **Volume down** and **Power** buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10-15 seconds).

2. When you feel the vibration, release the buttons, then immediately press and hold the **Volume down** button until you see a **large exclamation mark**.

3. Once the exclamation mark appears, press the following four buttons in this order:

   - Volume up
   - Volume down
   - Power
   - Volume down.

Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take a while for the reset to finish.)
