Once upon a time, there lived a man who loved the sun.
He aimed to be close to the sun, become one with it.
Such a pure form of admiration for all that is bright and white.
He despised everything that was dark.
People thought of him as a racist, but he was far above the realm of us mere mortals.

Then came the day of the reckoning, he met the sorcerer of white, who promised to take him closer to the sun if he found the everlasting orb for him.
The everlasting orb grew on a special kind of tree found at the center of the world.
So with joy and hope in his heart, our young wanna be protagonist, set out on his so called interesting adventure to find the everlasting orb.
The everlasting orb is guarded by a tribe of alien species who refer to them as the Sun tribe.
The sun tribe’s lives revolve around, you guessed right, the sun.
Sun tribe people are like nothing you’ve seen on this earth.
Their skins are covered in scales and their voices feel like the thunder rolling through the skies.
