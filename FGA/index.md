Auto-battle app for F/GO (Android 7 or later, no need for root on phones).  

Rewrite of [FGO-Lua](https://github.com/29988122/Fate-Grand-Order_Lua) as an Android app in Kotlin with UI for configuration and without a time-limit on use.  
It doesn't tamper with the game in anyway and works by looking at the screen and tapping things just like a normal user would do.  
It's not made to do the story for you, but to automate the mundane farming.

Check [Dependency Injection of extension functions in Kotlin]({% post_url /blog/2023-04-14-dependency-injection-extension-functions-kotlin %}) to see a kind of a design pattern I came up with while implementing FGA.
